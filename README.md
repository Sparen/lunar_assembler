Tool for making SVG maps from OpenStreetMap data, available as website and easy to use.

# Lunar assembler

# Potential uses

SVG files may be much more accessible for futher processing than alternatives formats of OSM data.

SVG files may be directly usable for some purposes, for example in laser cutters.

# Mentions of use are welcome

In case that you used this code or it inspired you to do something - feel free to create an issue with photo/description of what was produced! Or send an email to [matkoniecz@tutanota.com](mailto:matkoniecz@tutanota.com). It would be nice to have confirmation that publishing it was useful for somebody.

# Improving documentation

Please create a new issue if you want to use it but current instructions are insufficient, wrong or can be in some way improved!

I know that documentation may be far better, but I am not sure what kind of additional documentation would be most useful.

# Delibrately rejected features


Exact duplicates of more popular standard tags will not be supported (for example `landcover=water` or `landcover=trees`).

The [OpenStreetMap foundation](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page) was funding the development of this project in their first round of the [microgrant program](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Microgrants) in 2020. It was done as part of making [tactile maps based on OpenStreetMap data, for blind or visually impaired children](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Microgrants/Microgrants_2020/Proposal/Tactile_maps_for_blind_or_visually_impaired_children) (part of making used tools accessible to other and OpenStreetMao promotion).

If anyone else is also interested in supporting this project via funding - [let me know](mailto:osm-messages@etutanota.com) (opening a new issue is also OK) and it is likely that some way of doing that can be found :)
