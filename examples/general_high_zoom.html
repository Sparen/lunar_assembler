                <li>Move map to a small area interesting for you (a single park will work, generating map of Poland will fail).</li>
                <li>Press the "rectangle" button, select interesting area for you.</li>
                <li>Wait - waiting several seconds is normal, currently no progress info is displayed.</li>
                <li>Generated map should appear below map used for selecting, download should be also automatically triggered. There is also download button available below generated map image.</li>
                <li>Use this for something!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>      
        <p>Map style has support for areas such as buildings, water, parks, forests, road areas and linear features such as roads, railways, waterways, taxiway, runways. Produced SVG files can be downloaded.</p>

        <p>Have fun with using OpenStreetMap data for interesting and/or useful purposes! Just remember that you must mention source of data in way visible to whoever will be using it. See <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">this page</a> for details, including cases where it is legally allowed to avoid giving a clear credit (but I encourage to do this in all cases).</p>

        <p>If you liked this tool, something was confusing - you are welcomed to comment about it <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz/lunar_assembler/issues/new">by creating a public issue</a> or by sending me an <a href="mailto:matkoniecz@tutanota.com">email</a>.

        <p>If you want to help mapping and you are unsure how to start - you can try <a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete#download">StreetComplete</a> (an Android app) allowing contributions, with sole requirements being (1) ability to read (2) ability to see things (3) ability to create an OpenStreetMap acount.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to map something (map missing objects, fix mistake) and you are unsure how to start - visit <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">openstreetmap.org</a>, zoom in to interesting area and press "edit" button and follow instructions. You can contact OpenStreetMap community using one of global or local channels listed at <a href="https://community.osm.be/">community.osm.be</a>.</p>
