# Welcome!

Contributions are highly welcomed!

Bug reports, pull requests are welcomed and invited.

For bigger changes I strongly encourage to create an issue first to review the idea.

Issues with scatching criticism of code quality are also welcomed, as long as you are specific and clear what is wrong and how it can be improved.
