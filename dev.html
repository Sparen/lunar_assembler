    Generation of SVG files from OpenStreetMap data. Experimental proof of concept. Map style is very limited (support for areas such as buildings, water, parks, forests, area:highway).
    <ul>
    <li>Move map to a small area interesting for you (single park will work, generating map of Poland will fail).</li>
    <li>Press "rectangle" button, select interesting area for you.</li>
    <li>Wait - waiting several seconds is normal, currently no progress info is displayed.</li>
    <li>Generated map should appear below map used for selecting, download should be also automatically triggered. There is also download button available below generated map image.</li>
    <li>Use this for something!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you used this for something - you are welcomed to share it <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz/lunar_assembler/issues/new">publicly</a> or by sending my an <a href="mailto:matkoniecz@tutanota.com">email</a>.</p>

    <p>(there is more text below map)
    
    <div id="map" class="leaflet_interactive_map_not_hiding_further_content"></div>
<button id="download_generated_map" href="#" style="display: none">Download SVG</button>
  <div class="generated_svg_map_within" id="generated_svg_within"></div>
    <p id="instruction_hidden_after_first_generation">Press rectangle button, select rectangle on a map and wait</p>
  
    <p>Have fun with using OpenStreetMap data for interesting and/or useful purposes! Just remember that you must mention source of data in way visible to whoever will be using it. See <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">this page</a> for details, including cases where it is legally allowed to avoid giving a clear credit (but I encourage to do this in all cases).</p>

    <p>As mentioned this is experimental tool, many obvious issues are known - but if something was missed or you want to help see <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz/lunar_assembler/issues">list of known issues and TODOs</a></p>

    <p>If you want to help mapping and you are unsure how to start - you can try <a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete#download">StreetComplete</a> (an Android app) allowing contributions, with sole requirements being (1) ability to read (2) ability to see things (3) ability to create an OpenStreetMap acount.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to map something (map missing objects, fix mistake) and you are unsure how to start - visit <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">openstreetmap.org</a>, zoom in to interesting area and press "edit" button and follow instructions. You can contact OpenStreetMap community using one of global or local channels listed at <a href="https://community.osm.be/">community.osm.be</a>.</p>
